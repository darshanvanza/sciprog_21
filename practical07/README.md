## This is practical 7

1. **memory_allocation.c** : In this program all the things related to pointers like to allocate size dynamically, fill all the values with 1's in pointer array, printing array of pointer and free up space allocated to pointer at the end, all these things are done using different user defined functions.

2. **polynomial.c** : In this program we are finding the polynomial of nth order, where n is entered by user at run time and x=1(by default) and finding difference between e*1 - polynomial.

#### To compile and run

1. **memory_allocation.c** : gcc memory_allocation.c -o memory_allocation
			     ./memory_allocation

2. **polynomial.c** : gcc polynomial.c -o polynomial -lm
		      ./polynomial
